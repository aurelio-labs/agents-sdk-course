    "\n",
    "**R**etrieval **A**ugmented **G**eneration (RAG) is a powerful technique that enables AI agents to access and leverage external knowledge sources beyond their training data. In this tutorial, we'll build a RAG agent that can answer questions about the JFK assassination files using OpenAI's Agents SDK and Pinecone vector database.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is particularly useful when:\n",
    "- You need up-to-date information beyond the model's training cutoff\n",
    "- You have domain-specific documents or proprietary data\n",
    "- You want to reduce hallucinations by grounding responses in factual sources\n",
    "- You need to cite sources for transparency and verification\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you'll have built an agent that can search through historical documents and provide accurate, sourced answers about the JFK files."

       "   Oswald visited both the Cuban and Soviet Embassies in Mexico City at least twice, on September 26 and 27, 1963. He attempted to obtain visas or some form of travel permission to Cuba and possibly the Soviet Union. These visits are documented through embassy records and surveillance.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Seeking Travel Documents:**  \n",
       "   Oswald sought a visa to travel to Cuba and reportedly wanted to go to the Soviet Union afterward. However, the Cuban Embassy denied his visa request.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Surveillance by Mexican Authorities and CIA:**  \n",
       "   Mexican police and possibly CIA agents monitored Oswald during his stay. His activities, including interactions and movements, were documented, with some photos and surveillance reports available in the files.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Intent and Motive Ambiguity:**  \n",
       "   The purpose behind Oswald's trip and embassy visits is interpreted in various ways. Some documents suggest he was trying to defect or establish connections; others propose he was acting in a more complex intelligence context, though no conclusive evidence confirms involvement beyond these trips.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Importance of Mexico City Visits:  \n",
       "The visits are significant because they occurred just weeks before the assassination of President Kennedy on November 22, 1963. The government's investigations examined whether these contacts linked Oswald to intelligence operations or conspiratorial plans.\n",

       "\n",
       "- Kostikov was a consular officer, translator, vice-consul, and attache in Mexico City between 1961 and 1965.\n",
       "- In September/October 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald approached the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City to request a visa allowing him to return to the USSR. Kostikov handled this visa request.\n",
       "- There is no information in the files indicating any personal relationship between Kostikov and Oswald beyond the visa request.\n",
       "- After his Mexico City assignment, Kostikov was involved in monitoring Central American communist activities and reportedly provided funds and technical guidance to communist and left-wing groups.\n",
       "- He made trips to Moscow and Havana during his assignments.\n",
       "- There are references suggesting Kostikov was linked to the KGB, and discussions in the files consider whether he had any \"Active Measures\" (intelligence influence operations) role.\n",
       "- His activities and possible connections are part of the broader FBI and CIA interest in Soviet intelligence activities in Mexico during the period Oswald was there.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, Valeriy Kostikov was a Soviet consular official in Mexico at the time of Oswald’s visa request. While he is relevant as the Soviet Embassy officer who processed Oswald’s request, there is no definitive information in the JFK files proving a direct relationship or conspiratorial involvement with Oswald.\n",

       "> \"In September /October 1963 Lee Harvey Oswald approached the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City in an attempt to get a visa allowing him to return to the USSR. Kostikov, as a consular officer, handled this visa request. We have no information which indicates any relationship between these individuals other than for the purpose of Oswald's making his visa request.\"  \n",
