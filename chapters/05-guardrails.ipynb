With guardrails we add a layer of protection, enabling:\n",

A chatbot on a publicly accessible site without strong topical guardrails can essentially be used as a free chat AI — allowing users to avoid paying for their own chat AI use, and instead using your funds. At scale this type of misuse can be incredibly dangerous.\n",

    "Agents SDK provides a good guardrail experience out-of-the-box but we're limited to LLM-based guardrails. These are good but suffer from various problems that make them unsuitable as the _only_ line of defense in any production application. Those problems include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lack of transparency** — knowing that your system _will_ trigger a particular guardrail under certain circumstances and _why_ that happens is essential to building confidence and assurances when releasing AI software. LLMs struggle with this as they are non-deterministic and far too complex to accurately predict. The non-determinism of LLMs meaning that our output can change based on little-to-no change to input, and without the ability to predict their behaviour in a broad range of scenarios, they are simply dangerous to a company and their brand.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hard to tune** — trying to tune our agent to answer some questions, block other questions, or even answer differently to other questions is _very_ hard with LLM guardrails. This stems from their **lack of transparency** — it's hard to tune something that is so complex and opaque.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Latency** — **S**tate-**o**f-**t**he-**A**rt (SotA) LLMs tend to be big, that means we'll be dealing with a non-neglible latency increase by adding guardrails. This can be handled, especially with smaller LLMs (such as `gpt-4.1-nano` which we used above), but latency increases must be actively avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cost** — LLMs are expensive, this is an unavoidable outcome of their size, the bigger the LLM the more compute you need to run it, which in turn increases costs. Smaller LLMs can be more cost effective but will also lead to less accurate guardrails. As we add more guardrails we must also make more LLM calls — further increasing costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the SDK guardrails are easily modified to be triggered using alternative methods. Let's see how to integrate one of the most popular open-source libraries for AI guardrails — [Semantic Router](https://github.com/aurelio-labs/semantic-router)."
